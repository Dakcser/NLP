Intrusion detection plays an important role in ensuring information security, and the key technology is to accurately identify various attacks in the network. In this paper, we explore how to model an intrusion detection system based on deep learning, and we propose a deep learning approach for intrusion detection using recurrent neural networks (RNN-IDS). Moreover, we study the performance of the model in binary classification and multiclass classification, and the number of neurons and different learning rate impacts on the performance of the proposed model. We compare it with those of J48, artificial neural network, random forest, support vector machine, and other machine learning methods proposed by previous researchers on the benchmark data set. The experimental results show that RNN-IDS is very suitable for modeling a classification model with high accuracy and that its performance is superior to that of traditional machine learning classification methods in both binary and multiclass classification. The RNN-IDS model improves the accuracy of the intrusion detection and provides a new research method for intrusion detection.

With the increasingly deep integration of the Internet and society, the Internet is changing the way in which people live, study and work, but the various security threats that we face are becoming more and more serious. How to identify various network attacks, especially unforeseen attacks, is an unavoidable key technical issue. An Intrusion Detection System (IDS), a significant research achievement in the information security field, can identify an invasion, which could be an ongoing invasion or an intrusion that has already occurred. In fact, intrusion detection is usually equivalent to a classification problem, such as a binary or a multiclass classification problem, i.e., identifying whether network traffic behaviour is normal or anomalous, or a five-category classification problem, i.e., identifying whether it is normal or any one of the other four attack types: Denial of Service (DOS), User to Root (U2R), Probe (Probing) and Root to Local (R2L). In short, the main motivation of intrusion detection is to improve the accuracy of classifiers in effectively identifying the intrusive behaviour.
Machine learning methodologies have been widely used in identifying various types of attacks, and a machine learning approach can help the network administrator take the corresponding measures for preventing intrusions. However, most of the traditional machine learning methodologies belong to shallow learning and often emphasize feature engineering and selection; they cannot effectively solve the massive intrusion data classification problem that arises in the face of a real network application environment. With the dynamic growth of data sets, multiple classification tasks will lead to decreased accuracy. In addition, shallow learning is unsuited to intelligent analysis and the forecasting requirements of high-dimensional learning with massive data. In contrast, deep learners have the potential to extract better representations from the data to create much better models. As a result, intrusion detection technology has experienced rapid development after falling into a relatively slow period.
After Professor Hinton [1] proposed the theory of deep learning in 2006, deep learning theory and technology underwent a meteoric rise in the field of machine learning. In this scenario, relevant theoretical papers and practical research findings emerged endlessly and produced remarkable achievements, especially in the fields of speech recognition, image recognition [2] and action recognition [3]–[4][5]. The fact that deep learning theory and technology has had a very rapid development in recent years means that a new era of artificial intelligence has opened and offered a completely new way to develop intelligent intrusion detection technology.
Due to growing computational resources, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) (which have been around for decades but their full potential has only recently started to become widely recognized, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs)) have recently generated a significant development in the domain of deep learning [6]. In recent years, RNNs have played an important role in the fields of computer vision, natural language processing (NLP), semantic understanding, speech recognition, language modelling, translation, picture description, and human action recognition [7]–[8][9], among others.
Because deep learning has the potential to extract better representations from the data to create much better models, and inspired by recurrent neural networks, we have proposed a deep learning approach for an intrusion detection system using recurrent neural networks (RNN-IDS). The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows.
We present the design and implementation of the detection system based on recurrent neural networks. Moreover, we study the performance of the model in binary classification and multiclass classification, and the number of neurons and different learning rate impacts on the accuracy.
By contrast, we study the performance of the naive bayesian, random forest, multi-layer perceptron, support vector machine and other machine learning methods in multiclass classification on the benchmark NSL-KDD dataset.
We compare the performance of RNN-IDS with other machine learning methods both in binary classification and multiclass classification. The experimental results illustrate that RNN-IDS is very suitable for intrusion detection. The performance of RNN-IDS is superior to the traditional classification method on the NSL-KDD dataset in both binary and multiclass classification, and it improves the accuracy of intrusion detection, thus providing a new research method for intrusion detection.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we review the related research in the field of intrusion detection, especially how deep learning methods facilitate the development of intrusion detection. A description of a RNN-based IDS architecture and the performance evaluation measures are introduced in Section III. Section IV highlights RNN-IDS with a discussion about the experimental results and a comparison with a few previous studies using the NSL-KDD dataset. Finally, the conclusions are discussed in Section V.

The RNN-IDS model not only has a strong modelling ability for intrusion detection, but also has high accuracy in both binary and multiclass classification. Compared with traditional classification methods, such as J48, naive bayesian, and random forest, the performance obtains a higher accuracy rate and detection rate with a low false positive rate, especially under the task of multiclass classification on the NSL-KDD dataset. The model can effectively improve both the accuracy of intrusion detection and the ability to recognize the intrusion type. Of course, in the future research, we will still pay attention to reduce the training time using GPU acceleration, avoid exploding and vanishing gradients, and study the classification performance of LSTM, Bidirectional RNNs algorithm in the field of intrusion detection.
