Make sure to normalize the term tfidf and Nm tfidf weights and suggest a script to implement the preceding accordingly, so that the summarizer will contain the 10 sentences with the highest Sweight scores.  \n"

Therefore the sentence Sp that yields minimum value of “Sim(Sp, S1)+Sim(Sp,Sj)” will be included in the summarizer (Note: the quantity Sim(Sp, S1) is already calculated in previous step).  \n",
